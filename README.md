# 6.1010_Projects
 This is a collection of all of the programming labs I completed for 6.1010, Fundamental of Programming at MIT. **Note that while I wrote most of the code to implement functions, the test cases and code skeletons were provided by the course administrators. I also received some assistance from course assistants, and I collaborated on a high-level with fellow students.
